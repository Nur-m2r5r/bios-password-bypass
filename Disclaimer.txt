## Security Considerations

1. **Code Signing**: Consider signing your releases if distributing binaries
2. **Warnings**: Always include clear warnings about misuse
3. **Limitations**: Intentionally limit functionality to prevent abuse
4. **Logging**: Consider adding audit logging for sensitive operations

## GitHub Setup

1. Create a new repository
2. Add appropriate license (GPL-3.0 is common for security tools)
3. Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD
4. Include clear documentation
5. Add issue templates for bug reports

## Final Thoughts

This tool demonstrates basic concepts, but a production-grade tool would need:
- More comprehensive vendor support
- Better error handling
- Safety checks to prevent bricking systems
- More sophisticated password generation algorithms

Remember that BIOS/UEFI security is constantly evolving, and many modern systems have protections against these techniques.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this implementation?
